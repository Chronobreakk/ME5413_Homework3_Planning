# ME5413_Homework3_Planning

A brief description of what this project does and its purpose.

### Creating the Environment

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, then run the following command to create a new conda environment. The environment configuration is contained within the `environment.yml` file.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This command creates a new conda environment and installs all dependencies listed in the `environment.yml` file.

### Activating the Environment

After the environment is created and dependencies are installed, use the following command to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate amr
```

## Running the Notebook

With the environment set up and activated, you're ready to run the notebook file: `homework3.ipynb`.
